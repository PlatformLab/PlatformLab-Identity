# Platform Lab Identity Toolkit
This repository contains Platform Lab logos, symbols, and design guidelines for
posters, presentations, and other media associated with the Platform Lab, its
members, partners, and projects.

The logos and symbols should should not be altered in any way, such as
extending, condensing, outlining, adding borders, special effects or drop
shadows, or attaching other words or graphics. Multiple versions are made
available to accommodate most needs.

## Recommend Logo Versions
The recommended use of the Platform Lab logo is in color on either a white or
black background.

*Note that due to the grey text in the recommended color logos featured below,
neither logo should be used on grey backgrounds (see "Repository Contents"
for other options).*

### For White Backgrounds
